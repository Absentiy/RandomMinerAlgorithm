# RandomMinerAlgorithm
A simple program that can generate somewhat nice levels.
I did it when I was bored so I didn't thought about code quality.

#### Minecraft?
There is also a feature where you can generate files for Minecraft mod Ruins(https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ruins-structure-spawning-system)
But the result is kind of strange I think.
